# bids-examples

This repository contains a set of
(https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) datasets with **empty raw data
files**. These datasets can be useful to:

1. write lightweight software tests
1. serve as an example on how a BIDS dataset can be structured

**ALL RAW DATA FILES IN THIS REPOSITORY ARE EMPTY!**

However for some of the data, the headers containing the metadata are still
intact. (For example the NIfTI headers for `.nii` files, the BrainVision data
headers for `.vhdr` files, or the OME-XML headers for `.ome.tif` files.)

Headers are intact for the following datasets:

- `synthetic`
- Most EEG or iEEG data in BrainVision format (e.g., `eeg_matchingpennies`)

## Validating BIDS examples

The next three sections mention a few details on how the `bids-examples` can be
validated using `bids-validator`.

For general information on the `bids-validator`, including installation and
usage, see the
(https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator#quickstart).

### Validating individual examples

Since all raw data files in this repository are empty, the `bids-validator` must
to be configured to not report empty data files as errors. (See more on
bids-validator configuration in the
(https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator#configuration).)

Just run the validator as follows (using the `eeg_matchingpennies` dataset as an
example, and assuming you are in a command line at the root of the
`bids-examples` repository):

`bids-validator eeg_matchingpennies --config.ignore=99`

The `--config.ignore=99` "flag" tells the bids-validator to ignore empty data
files rather than to report the "empty file" error .

For datasets that contain NIfTI `.nii` files, you also need to add the
`ignoreNiftiHeaders` flag to the `bids-validator` call, to suppress the issue
that NIfTI headers are not found.

For example:

`bids-validator ds003 --config.ignore=99 --ignoreNiftiHeaders`
